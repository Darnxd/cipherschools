# Hospital Management System (Python)

## Project Description

    This is a simple Hospital Management System created using Python. This project helps to manage patient information using a computer. It is useful for storing patient details safely and easily.

    In this project, the user can add new patient details, view all patient records, search for a patient using their ID, and delete patient records if needed. All the patient data is saved in a file, so the data is not lost after closing the program.

## Features

    * Add new patient
    * View patient details
    * Search patient by ID
    * Delete patient record
    * Save patient data in a file

## Technologies Used

    * Python
    * File handling
    * List and Dictionary
    * Functions and Loops

## Project Files

    * hospital_management.py – main program file
    * patients.txt – file used to store patient data
    * README.md – file that explains the project

## How to Run

    1. Install Python
    2. Open the project folder
    3. Run hospital_management.py
    4. Follow the instructions shown on the screen

## Purpose

    The purpose of this project is to learn Python programming and understand how to store and manage data using file handling.
